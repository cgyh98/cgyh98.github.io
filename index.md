### Mapping Poverty in Lima with Machine Learning and Satellite Imagery 

<div style="text-align: justify">Developed a novel methodology combining satellite imagery analysis with AI to map socioeconomic patterns across Lima Metropolitana. I developed and implemented a custom computer vision pipeline using Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) for feature extraction and SVM classifiers. This project established a new framework for AI-driven urban analysis and efficient remote sensing data processing through Python-based geoprocessing tools.</div>
<br>

**Technical skills:** Python, CNNs, SVM, GIS, remote sensing data processing.
<br>

**Impact**: Created scalable methodology for urban poverty mapping and influenced regional policy discussions.

### Monitoring the Evolution of Glaciers surface in the Peruvian Andes

***Climate Change AI, Summer School 2024 @ Mila - Quebec AI Institute***
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">During one week, we worked on developing an automated pipeline for monitoring glacier surface area evolution in Peruvian Andes. Our team designed and implemented a prototype for an end-to-end system combining satellite imagery analysis with ML to generate annual area estimates for regional glaciers. This project was developed within interdisciplinary team framework, incorporating responsible AI principles and climate impact considerations.</div>
<br>

**Technical skills:** Python, remote sensing data processing, data visualization.
<br>

**Impact:** Streamlined glacier inventory process for researchers and enhanced public awareness through accessible visualization of climate change effects.

### Data driven Approach for Road Safety in Nagpur, India

***FruitPunch AI, AI for Road Safety Challenge***
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">Our team developed interactive visualization tools that enabled stakeholders to identify new insights about road safety in Nagpur, India. While other teams focused on statistical analysis, our tool's interactive nature allowed for rapid identification of spatial and temporal patterns. By incorporating data about hospitals and schools and aggregating everything with spatial indexes, we helped identify risk-prone areas that required immediate attention. </div>
<br>

**Technical skills:** Python, Interactive Data Visualization with Deck.gl, Spatial Indexing, GIS. 
<br>

**Impact:** Showcased how spatial indexing and interactive data visualization can be leveraged to address critical urban challenges.

### Leveraging telecom data to Study tourists mobility patterns in Andorra 
***Internship “Living Lab Andorra”***
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">During the internship, I developed a comprehensive mobility analysis for tourist behavior using RNC (Radio Network Controller) data. First, I designed and implemented data processing pipeline to construct user trajectories from network signals. Then, I created a trajectory visualization framework and engineered sub-trajectory clustering model to identify and analyze frequent tourist routes, enabling data-driven tourism insights.</div>
<br>

**Technical skills:** Mobility analysis, clustering algorithms, RNC data processing, spatial visualization.
<br>

**Impact:** Established methodology for understanding tourist movement patterns using network data.
